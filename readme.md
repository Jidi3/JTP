**Jidi's Offical Texture Pack**

 
This is my Offical Texture/Resource pack.

It is combination of my own designs and edits and others that I have liked and added to it. 

I have credited bellow all of the packs I have taken parts of and merged into my own:
- **Leowook's Pack** (custom Netherite and Diamond armour) - [Link](https://discord.gg/xu4VvUPJr4) 
- **Vitalasy's Resource pack** (Dark background and UI's) - [Link](https://discord.gg/bUnnhrP)
- **Vanilla tweaks** (ores, grass, dyes, note blocks and ui backgrounds) - [Link](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/)

Renaming tools and armour to "Jidi" will give some a custom texture!

- Currently Supporting 1.18 - 1.19.2 on Java.
